## Overview

This repository contains the official device firmware for MESHCN, an open-source LoRa mesh networking project designed for long-range, low-power communication without relying on internet or cellular infrastructure. The firmware supports various hardware platforms, including ESP32, nRF52, RP2040/RP2350, and Linux-based devices.
